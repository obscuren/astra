- [x] **Space station types** — Normal/Scav/Pirate/Abandoned/Infested with unique per-station keepers and specialty rooms (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-space-station-types-design.md)

### World Generation
- [x] **Procedural world lore** — billions of years of layered history, 2-5 precursor civilizations, beacon network toward Sgr A*
- [x] **Phoneme-based naming** — 6 syllable pools, procedural civilization/figure/artifact names
- [x] **Developer history log** — `history` dev console command dumps full timeline
- [x] **Lore save/load** — WorldLore persisted via tagged LORE section
- [x] **Lore-driven galaxy shaping** — system tiers, lore annotations, star chart markers, dungeon entry text
- [x] **Galaxy simulation engine** — state-driven civ sim with traits, inter-species interactions, visual generation screen
- [ ] **Legendary artifact generation** — unique items tied to historical figures and events
- [ ] **Lore fragment items** — data crystals, memory engrams as ground pickups in lore-significant ruins
- [ ] **Lore fragment system** — discoverable history pieces, progressive revelation via journal codex
- [ ] **Starting lore fragment** — player receives a race-specific lore record at game start
- [x] **Terrain shaping from lore** — megastructures as orbital POIs, beacons as unique landmarks, terraforming alters biome, weapon tests scar terrain
- [ ] **Archaeology skill effects** — Excavation active ability, Precursor Linguist sealed doors, Beacon Sense on star chart, Cultural Attunement stat bonuses
- [ ] **Civilization-themed dungeon aesthetics** — tile palette, fixture types, room flavors per precursor civilization
- [ ] **Archaeological strata** — deeper dungeon levels = older civilization layers
- [ ] New dungeon generator types / biomes
- [x] **Outpost POI** — fenced fort with main building, exterior tents, campfires, biome-themed palisade
- [ ] **Outpost dungeon portal** — rare (~20%) chance of a dungeon entrance beneath an outpost
- [ ] **Outpost kind variants** — forward base / refuge / scoundrel hideout / traveler camp with distinct NPCs and loot
- [ ] **Outpost reputation / hostility** — hostile outposts spawn combatants instead of traders
- [x] **Crashed Ship POI** — three classes (escape pod / freighter / corvette), 4-way orientation, long scorched skid marks that plow through scatter, debris field, rare dungeon portal
- [ ] **Crashed ship dungeon theming** — wreck-themed dungeon content when the portal hits
- [ ] **Crashed ship kind variants** — pirate / civilian / military / alien flavoring via scatter + fixture palettes
- [ ] **Crashed ship lore logs** — readable captain's log fixture on cockpit console
- [ ] **Aquatic crashed ships** — partially submerged hull rendering
- [ ] **Haunted wrecks** — optional creature spawning inside wrecks
- [x] **Landing Pad POI removed** — replaced with Tab → Ship tab → Board Ship action. Planet arrival spawns at deterministic center-adjacent tile. `Tile::OW_Landing` is a deprecated no-op.
- [x] **Board Ship action** — character screen Ship tab has an action row that warps the player into the Starship map from any planet overworld tile; disembarking restores the saved overworld position
- [x] **Cave Entrance POI** — three variants (natural cave / abandoned mine / ancient excavation) with cliff-embedded placement and lore-weighted selection
- [ ] **Cave entrance dungeon theming** — variant-specific dungeon generators beneath the portal
- [ ] **Additional cave variants** — flooded cave, sealed vault entrance, collapsed shaft
- [ ] **Ice cave variants** — frozen entrances with crystal fixtures in Ice biome
- [ ] **Beacon POI** — parked. Ground anchor for a Sgr A* lore beacon spire. Needs design work — scope, interaction, how it ties into star chart and lore tier progression. Existing `OW_Beacon` tile type and legacy detail-map stamp remain as placeholders.
- [ ] **Megastructure POI** — parked. Ground anchor for a precursor megastructure. Needs design work — scope, scale, how it ties into multi-tile terrain. Existing `OW_Megastructure` tile type and legacy detail-map stamp remain as placeholders.
- [x] **Layered POI site selection** — deterministic per-planet `PoiBudget` drives a unified placement pass that expands the budget into prioritised `PoiRequest`s, scores candidate sites against terrain requirements, and writes anchor hints (cliff/water adjacency with direction) for stage-2 generators. Kills the cave-entrance PlacementScorer bypass for variant selection. Design + plan in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-poi-budget-and-hidden-ruins-design.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-11-poi-budget-and-hidden-ruins.md`.
- [x] **Hidden ruin discovery** — subset of ruins rolled hidden at budget time, render as underlying biome until stepped on, then log to the Journal (`JournalCategory::Discovery`) with a live overworld preview. Discovery counts feed the Scanner Report on the star chart planet info panel and will extend to the ship scanner component later.
- [ ] More overworld POI stamps (temples, factories, research labs)
- [ ] **Interactive shelves** — 3-tile shelf structures (║~║ or ═~═) against walls; middle tile holds lootable item (book, scroll, data crystal); picking up item reverts to empty shelf
- [ ] Derelict station expansion — more room types

### Items & Gear
- [ ] New weapon types
- [x] **Ship components and upgrades** — ShipSlot system, Mk1 components, cargo hold
- [ ] Consumables with effects (stims, shields, scanners)

### Starship
- [x] **Ship component system** — 6 equipment slots, Ship tab in character pane, install/uninstall
- [x] **Ship cargo hold** — separate inventory for ship components
- [x] **ARIA ship AI** — command terminal with context-aware dialog, ship systems access
- [x] **Tutorial quest "Getting Airborne"** — repair ship with 3 components, skip option
- [x] **Maintenance tunnels** — hub station dungeon with Engine Coil + Xytomorphs
- [x] **Observatory view-only star chart** — can browse but not travel
- [ ] Ship combat (space encounters)
- [ ] Ship weapons / utility slots
- [ ] **Ship scanner component** — installable utility that scans planets and systems. Base tier reveals total POI counts on planet info screen; upgraded tiers split visible vs uncharted (see layered POI budget) and eventually reveal hidden POI positions. System-level scans surface body summaries on the star chart. Ties into the Archaeology skill line (Beacon Sense / Ruin Reader augment scanner results).

## UI/UX

- [x] **Conversation dialog in contextual menu** — NPC speech shown as body text in PopupMenu
- [x] **Minimap** — half-block pixel minimap widget (F3), 3x3 downsampling, player-centered, all map types
- [x] **Ability bar** — display and activate learned abilities (keys 1-5)
- [x] **Message log scrollback** — scroll through message history
- [x] **Quest tab categorization** — Main Missions / Contracts / Bounties / Completed; arcs rendered under Main with active, locked (title/hidden), and completed steps inline
- [ ] **Item comparison** — show stat diff when hovering equipment
- [ ] **Character panel tab memory** — remember the last active tab; reopening shows the same tab
- [x] **Equipment tab read-only** — side panel equipment is display-only
- [x] **Remove inventory from side panel** — inventory management via character screen only
